This repository contains my early practice with JavaScript ES6+ features. It represents my first hands-on approach to modern JavaScript syntax and concepts as part of preparing myself for building projects using React.

This practice helped me get comfortable with writing cleaner and more modern JavaScript code. It also served as a stepping stone to understanding how ES6+ features are used in real-world React applications.

These files were created as part of my self-study and experimentation while exploring the core ideas of JavaScript ES6 and beyond.
